  abstract  = {Usability and accessibility evaluations with diverse users are an essential part of an iterative universal design process for digital solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to run traditional local evaluations due to social distancing restrictions to reduce infections. Remote synchronous and asynchronous evaluation methods may be a solution if it can be used by various user groups, including people with impairments. Incorporating video conferencing systems into traditional remote evaluations can be a valuable supplement to—or, given the current situation, alternative to—traditional usability and accessibility evaluations. We present a protocol for remote formative usability evaluations designed with accessibility in mind. The protocol explains how to prepare for an evaluation and its technical setup, how to conduct synchronous evaluations using video conferencing systems, and how to debrief and analyze the collected data. We tested this protocol in a pilot study for an ongoing project where we ran both synchronous and asynchronous remote evaluations. In our pilot, the synchronous evaluation using video conferencing systems provided opportunities for richer qualitative data than the asynchronous evaluation as we ran it. The findings from the pilot study indicate that the protocol is feasible and can be used when having participants with diverse abilities or impairments. We also provide suggestions for others that wish to adapt the protocol.},

  abstract     = {eXtended Reality (XR) provides new opportunities for immersive and engaging ways of learning in primary and secondary education. Educators and educational decision-makers, however, lack knowledge about the opportunities of this emerging technology. At the same time, XR technology lacks a fundamental universal design framework targeted at improving accessibility and usability for all, specifically for pupils with disabilities. In the following paper, we present the results from two selective and weighed literature reviews identifying: (1) opportunities, positive outcomes and challenges of using XR technology in primary and secondary education; (2) general advantages and limitations in terms of universal design, including barriers and possible solutions of XR technology for pupils with disabilities. The results show that utilization of XR technology in primary and secondary education is versatile, may positively influence learning outcomes in pupils, contributes to increase motivation, engagement, and interest. The challenges in implementing XR technology were mainly related to economic cost, health-related limitations, pedagogy, editorial limitations, and lack of universal design. Pupils with disabilities and varying degrees of abilities face challenges because there is lack of multimodality, practical issues when setting up or using devices, lack of interoperability and compatibility with assistive technology, financial costs, health-related issues, overreliance on gamification, and ethical considerations. In addition, most devices are designed for adults and not recommended to be used by children younger than 13 years of age. Future research needs to address development of guidelines including best-practice examples for increased accessibility and usability of XR technology, as well as advance the standardization and solidification of said guidelines into standards, regulations, and laws.},

	life due to the fact that some colors appear less differentiable
	than for normal sighted people. So-called daltonization methods have
	been proposed to increase color contrast for color-deficient people.
	We propose two methods for better daltonization solutions by Spatial
	Intensity Channel Replacement Daltonization (SIChaRDa). We propose
	replacing the intensity channel with a grayscale version of the image
	computed by using spatial color-to-gray methods that are either capable
	of translating color contrasts into lightness contrasts or that are
	capable of translating color edges into lightness edges, and/or integrating
	information from the red–green channel into the intensity channel.
	We tested two implementations on different types of images, and we
	could show that results depend on the one hand on the algorithm used
	for computing the grayscale image, and on the other hand on the content
	of the image. We show that the spatial methods work best on real-life
	images were confusing colors are directly adjacent to each other,
	respectively where they are in close proximity. On the contrary,
	using composed artificial images with borders of white space between
	colors – like for example in the Ishihara plates – leads only to
	unsatisfactory results.},
