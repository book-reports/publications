  abstract  = {Usability and accessibility evaluations with diverse users are an essential part of an iterative universal design process for digital solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult to run traditional local evaluations due to social distancing restrictions to reduce infections. Remote synchronous and asynchronous evaluation methods may be a solution if it can be used by various user groups, including people with impairments. Incorporating video conferencing systems into traditional remote evaluations can be a valuable supplement to—or, given the current situation, alternative to—traditional usability and accessibility evaluations. We present a protocol for remote formative usability evaluations designed with accessibility in mind. The protocol explains how to prepare for an evaluation and its technical setup, how to conduct synchronous evaluations using video conferencing systems, and how to debrief and analyze the collected data. We tested this protocol in a pilot study for an ongoing project where we ran both synchronous and asynchronous remote evaluations. In our pilot, the synchronous evaluation using video conferencing systems provided opportunities for richer qualitative data than the asynchronous evaluation as we ran it. The findings from the pilot study indicate that the protocol is feasible and can be used when having participants with diverse abilities or impairments. We also provide suggestions for others that wish to adapt the protocol.},
